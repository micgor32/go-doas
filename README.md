[`doas`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doas) is a minimal replacement for the venerable `sudo`. It was
initially [written by Ted Unangst](http://www.tedunangst.com/flak/post/doas)
of the OpenBSD project to provide 95% of the features of `sudo` with a
fraction of the codebase. `go-doas` is a minimal Go implementation of [OpenDoas](https://github.com/Duncaen/OpenDoas) port.
